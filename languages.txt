- What is your favorite programming language? Why?
	My favorite programming language is Python because it is such an efficient, userfriendly, and simple language.
	It keeps many of the similarities and benefits of Java Script while getting rid of the complexities and issues Java
	as well.
- Is your favorite language the one you are also most experienced with? If not, which language are you most experienced with?
	No, my favorite language, Python, is not the one I am the most experienced with. The programming language I am the
	most experienced with is Java Script.
